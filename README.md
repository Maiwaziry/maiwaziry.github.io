## Projects
### Environmental Hazards Mapping In Major Cities In United States
In this project, we investigated the built environment's impact on clustering hazards in major cities in the United States. Most notably, the infrastructure of streets alongside the tree canopy together contribute to inequitable clusters of hazards where disadvantaged communities exist.

## Manuscript: Underreview  
## Map of street density and tree canopy in two cities from the sample of cities in the study. On the top is Jersey City, while at the bottom is Oakland City in California.
