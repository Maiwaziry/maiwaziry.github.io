## Welcome!

## Bio
My name is Mai, and I am a PhD student at UMB. I use different computational methods to understand the underlying causal mechanisms between urban planning, the built environment and the connection of that with the environment. As a side note, I am an avid runner and fencer!

## Research interests

- Computational Social Science
- Urban Informatics
- Spatial Causal Inference 
- Environmental Justice

**Impact of Societal and Environmental Changes on Bike-Sharing Systems** 


## Fellowships

Richard Lowell's public service fellow at Massport Authority: I spent the fellowship with the urban development team at Massport. During my fellowship, I created a dashboard to help in strategic planning for climate change adaptations for their buildings. In this dashboard, I utilized data from different sources to map the distribution of heat, tree canopy, sea level rise, and floor elevation to identify buildings at risk.
