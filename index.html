        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Mai, and I am a computational social science researcher. I use different computational methods to understand the underlying causal mechanisms between urban planning, the built environment, human perception, and the connection of that with the environment. As a side note, I am an avid runner and fencer!</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Environmental Hazards Mapping In Major Cities In United States</h3>
        <p>In this project, we investigated the built environment's impact on clustering hazards in major cities in the United States. Most notably, the infrastructure of streets alongside the tree canopy together contribute to inequitable clusters of hazards where disadvantaged communities exist.</p>

        <h3>Impact of Societal and Environmental Changes on Bike-Sharing Systems</h3>
        <p>In this project, we explored the causal mechanisms underlying the exposure to air pollution and how this is connected to bike ridership in Boston.</p>

        <h2>Fellowships</h2>
        <p><strong>Richard Lowell's Public Service Fellow at Massport Authority:</strong> I spent the fellowship with the urban development team at Massport. During my fellowship, I created a dashboard to help in strategic planning for climate change adaptations for their buildings. In this dashboard, I utilized data from different sources to map the distribution of heat, tree canopy, sea level rise, and floor elevation to identify buildings at risk.</p>
